# Uber's NSIS Installers

This repository contains NSIS installer scripts and support files for
Uber Entertainment products.

## Visual C++ 11.0 (Visual Studio 2012) redistributable

The scripts contain NSIS macros to correctly detect & install the Visual
C++ 11.0 runtime (from Visual Studio 2012.)

You can find this code in [VCRedist11.nsh](VCRedist11.nsh) -- it should
be easy to reuse in your personal project, and everything is liberally
licensed.
